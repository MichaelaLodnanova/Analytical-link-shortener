> Authors: xlodnan, xberky, xfalesn, xturek

## Description
An app inspired by bit.ly. 
A regular user can generate a shortened link on which he has the option to either enable or disable advertising. 
This can then be shared. 
Advertisers can also create accounts in the app and add their advertisements to the platform.
When the user clicks on the shortened link (if the ad is enabled), the ad will be displayed to the user and when the ad ends/skipped, it will redirect the user to the original link. 
Both the authors of the shortened link and the advertisers can track statistics about the clicks on their links (advertisements).

## Requirements
* redirecting from shortened links
* display of advertisements
* authentication/authorization of users
* links management

* overview of relevant analytics (number of impressions, number of skips, time spent by the user on the ad, region and language of users...)
